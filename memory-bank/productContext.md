# Product Context

## Problem Space
Organizations using Notion as their knowledge base face several challenges:
1. Limited search capabilities within Notion
2. Difficulty understanding relationships between documents
3. No native support for semantic search
4. Limited ability to extract and analyze document relationships
5. Need for specialized vector search capabilities

## Solution
The LLM Notion Loader addresses these challenges by:
1. Synchronizing Notion content to Pinecone vector database
2. Using LLMs to understand document relationships
3. Enabling vector-based semantic search
4. Storing relationships as metadata in vectors
5. Providing efficient vector search capabilities
