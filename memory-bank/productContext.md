# Product Context

## Problem Space
Organizations using Notion as their knowledge base face several challenges:
1. Limited search capabilities within Notion
2. Difficulty understanding relationships between documents
3. No native support for semantic search
4. Limited ability to extract and analyze document relationships
5. Need for specialized database capabilities (vector search, graph relationships)

## Solution
The LLM Notion Loader addresses these challenges by:
1. Synchronizing Notion content to specialized databases
2. Using LLMs to understand document relationships
3. Enabling vector-based semantic search
4. Representing content relationships in graph databases
5. Supporting multiple storage backends for different use cases
